# Digital Pet Project

A cute and goofy digital pet that runs on Pi400 during livestreams with nostalgic title sequences and system metric reactivity.

## Overview
This project creates a reactive digital pet that responds to system metrics like CPU temperature and usage, featuring nostalgic title sequences inspired by pop culture references like Final Fantasy VIII intros. The digital pet serves as an engaging companion during livestreams, providing entertainment and real-time system status information.

## Features
- **System Metric Reactivity**: Responds to CPU usage, temperature, memory consumption, and network activity
- **Nostalgic Title Sequences**: Features retro-style animations and music reminiscent of classic games
- **Pi400 Optimized**: Specifically designed for the Raspberry Pi 400 hardware
- **Livestream Integration**: Engaging visual elements perfect for stream audiences
- **Customizable Avatars**: Multiple pet types and personalities to choose from
- **Real-time Status Display**: Shows system health and performance metrics in a fun way

## Architecture
The digital pet project consists of several key components:

### Core Engine
- Hardware abstraction layer for Pi400-specific optimizations
- Real-time metric polling and processing
